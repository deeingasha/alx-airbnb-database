# Advanced SQL Scripts for Airbnb Database

This folder contains advanced SQL scripts and documentation for analyzing, optimizing, and monitoring the Airbnb database. The scripts demonstrate complex SQL concepts such as joins, subqueries, aggregations, window functions, partitioning, and performance optimization.

## Contents

- **joins_queries.sql**  
  Examples of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN queries to combine data from multiple tables.

- **subqueries.sql**  
  Demonstrates both correlated and non-correlated subqueries for advanced data filtering and analysis.

- **aggregations_and_window_functions.sql**  
  Shows how to use aggregation functions (COUNT, AVG, etc.) and window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER) for data analysis.

- **partitioning.sql**  
  Scripts for partitioning tables to improve query performance and manage large datasets.

- **perfomance.sql**  
  SQL queries and techniques for improving database performance.

- **performance_monitoring.md**  
  Documentation on monitoring database performance and identifying bottlenecks.

- **partition_performance.md**  
  Analysis of partitioning strategies and their impact on query performance.

- **optimization_report.md**  
  Report summarizing optimization strategies applied to the database.

- **index_performance.md**  
  Documentation on index usage and its effect on query speed.
